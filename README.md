OVERVIEW : Our project, "All Things EV " demonstrates the application of web development skills learned in ICS 2107, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to solve a real-world problem. The site provides a centralized platform for locating and booking electric vehicle charging stations in Kenya, showcasing efficient design and functionality while adhering to CRAP principles to enhance usability and aesthetics.

Project Objective The objective of this project was to create a user-friendly and efficient web application showcasing practical applications of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as taught in the ICS 2107 course. Additionally, the project sought to integrate supplementary technologies to display and manage data effectively.

Problem Statement In Kenya, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is increasing as people embrace sustainable transportation. However, there is a significant gap: the lack of a centralized system providing real-time information on charging station locations, availability, and scheduling. Our system aims to address this gap by providing users with a platform to find and book EV charging stations conveniently.

Technologies Used • HTML: For structuring the web page. • CSS: For styling and layout, adhering to the CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) design principles. • JavaScript: For adding interactivity, dynamic content rendering, and handling user input. • db.json: Used as a simple data source to simulate backend functionality and provide data for charging stations. • Github & Github pages has been used to deploy the site.

Implementation Overview The project comprises: • Homepage: ◦ A responsive navigation bar with links for Home, Booking, and About sections. ◦ A slideshow highlighting the importance of EVs with a motivational tagline. • Charging Stations Section: 3 of 4 ◦ Dynamically generated cards displaying charging station details (e.g., location, cost, compatibility). ◦ Buttons for booking time slots, with interactive feedback for users. • Search Functionality: ◦ A search bar that filters charging stations by location or description. • Footer: ◦ Links to social media, newsletter subscription, and additional information about the project.

Application of CRAP Principles • Contrast: ◦ Color schemes were chosen to create a clear visual hierarchy, such as dark navigation bars contrasting with light card backgrounds. ◦ Buttons use hover effects for clear interaction feedback. • Repetition: ◦ Consistent styling of buttons, fonts, and card layouts across the site to create a cohesive design. • Alignment: ◦ Content is centrally aligned to ensure a clean and professional appearance. ◦ Elements such as text, images, and buttons within cards are aligned uniformly. • Proximity: ◦ Related elements, such as station details and booking buttons, are grouped together to improve usability.

Challenges Encountered • Time Constraints: ◦ Project implementation was time-strained, given the limited time. • Integration of db.json: ◦ While not covered in class, using db.json to simulate backend functionality required additional research and troubleshooting. • Responsiveness: 4 of 4 ◦ Ensuring that the website maintained usability across different screen sizes required careful CSS adjustments.

Gains from the Project • Enhanced understanding of integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real-world projects. • Practical experience in implementing CRAP principles for user�friendly design. • Exposure to working with JSON data for dynamic content management. • Improved problem-solving skills through debugging and testing.

Conclusion This project demonstrates how the technologies taught in ICS 2107 can be applied to solve real-world problems. By creating a functional and aesthetically pleasing web application, we showcased the practical relevance of web development skills. With further development and integration with real-time data from existing charging stations, this system has the potential to address the growing need for EV infrastructure in Kenya.
